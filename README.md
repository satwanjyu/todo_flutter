  - [ ] flutter pub upgrade
  - [ ] Deprecation warning fails CI
- [ ]  Animations
- [x]  l10n
- [ ]  Platform adaptations (just Cupertino for now)
- [ ]  Adaptation for alternative HID

- [ ]  Form preservation
- [ ]  Accessibility
- [ ]  Plugin system via embedded Lua
- [ ]  Org-mode integration (I really want native notifications)
