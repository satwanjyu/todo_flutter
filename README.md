# Demo todo App implemented with Flutter

Playground for technologies I'd like to try out before implementing on prod. E.g.
- Advance testing
- CI
- Automate dependency bumping
  - Platform dependencies (AGP & friends)
  - Flutter pubspec
  - Deprecation warning fails the CI
- Animations
- i18n
- Platform adaptations (just Cupertino for now)
- Dealing with alternative input methods
- State restoration
- Form preservation
- Accessibility
- Plugin system via embedded Lua
- Org-mode integration (I really want native notifications)
