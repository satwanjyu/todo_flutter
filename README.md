# Demo todo App implemented with Flutter

[![CI](https://github.com/satwanjyu/todo_flutter/actions/workflows/flutter-action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/satwanjyu/todo_flutter/actions/workflows/flutter-action.yml)

Playground for technologies I'd like to try out before implementing on prod.
- [x] CI
- [ ] Automate dependency bumping (does GitHub Actions do crontab?)
  - [ ] Platform dependencies (AGP & friends)
  - [ ] flutter pub upgrade
  - [ ] Deprecation warning fails CI
- [ ]  Animations
- [x]  l10n
- [ ]  Platform adaptations (just Cupertino for now)
- [ ]  Adaptation for alternative HID
- [ ]  State restoration
- [ ]  Form preservation
- [ ]  Accessibility
- [ ]  Plugin system via embedded Lua
- [ ]  Org-mode integration (I really want native notifications)
- [ ]  Deep-linking
